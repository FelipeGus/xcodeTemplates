# Xcode File Templates
A repository to organize the templates I daily use when working with Xcode.

Feel free to fork and use/modify any of them ðŸ˜„!

If you see any improvement/error just submit a PR.

## Current Templates.
* VMVC - A small template for the creation of a View Controller and a View Model
with reactive communication between them.

## Future Planned Templates.
- [ ] View Controller Presenter - A template like the VMVC but with a presenter in place of the viewModel
 with interface for the communication between the two.

- [ ] VIPER - A simple template for the VIPER architecture, with separation of the files in folders.

- [ ] DataSource/Delegate Objects - Objects that serve as dataSources/delegates of Table and Collection Views.

- [ ] Coordinator - A template for the creation of coordinators (Flow controllers).

## Requirements
  - You just need Xcode really :).

  ** Some templates use third party Libraries, like the RxSwift for the VMVC template, I'm planning on reducing dependencies in future, but for now, just remove them if you don't need it. **

## How to use
  To use these templates you just have to put their folders where Xcode will look for them.

  If you want it to appear at the beggining of the page when creating a new file put them here:

  ```
  /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Library/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/
  ```

  You will have to do this every time you get a new installation of Xcode though,
  and the template will appear only in the version of xcode you put these on.

  If you want your templates to be shared by all Xcode versions,
  not depending on you to add them every single installation, put them here.  

  ```
  ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates
  ```

  And that's about it. Any doubts feel free to mail me :)
